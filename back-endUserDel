# CSS and OpenDCIM header code can be built around this for uniformity...worked nicely for me.

<h1>Remove OpenDCIM User</h1>
//
// A VERY simple PHP form that takes user input from web page and removes back-end IDs using htpasswd. Once the backend 
// user data is removed, the OpenDCIM UI interface can be used to disable a user or overwrite them to a different user.
//
// Adding a link to this page in 'usermgr.php' makes it easy to find :)
//
<form action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>" method="post">
//
// You'll see there isn't a lot of input sanitation going on here. I was trying to keep it clean, so use with care.
//
Enter Username: <input type="text" name="nuser"><br><br>
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Delete"><br>
</form>

<?php
//
// I had some trouble variablizing the environment variables directly from _POST. Rather than waste time troubleshooting whatever
// syntax I was mangling I merely dumped them in a place holder var (d) that I could call cleanly.
//
        $d=$_POST["nuser"];
        putenv("NUSER=$d");

        $before = exec('grep $NUSER .htpasswd');
        exec('sed -i s/$NUSER//g .htpasswd');
        $after = exec('grep $NUSER .htpasswd');
        echo "<br>Entry before change: ",$before;
        echo "<br>Entry after change: ",$after;
        $before = "";
        $after = "";
        $d="";
?>

// Button returns you to previous user UI page.
